## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend: PocketBase

- **Collections**: users, teams, picks, deadlines, winning_teams

### Frontend: React + Vite
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier) with automatic GitHub deployments  
- **Features**: Modern React hooks, React Router, responsive design
- **API Integration**: Axios for PocketBase and Premier League data
- **Testing**: Vitest with 16 unit tests covering core game logic

### Database Schema
- **users**: first_name, last_name, email, isAdmin
- **teams**: 20 Premier League teams (2025/26 season)  
- **picks**: user_id, team_id, week_number (auto-created)
- **deadlines**: week_number, deadline_date/time, status
- **winning_teams**: week_number, team_id (multiple per week)

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Production Deployment (Recommended)

**Backend Setup (PocketHost)**
1. Sign up at pockethost.io ($5/month)  
2. Create new PocketBase instance
3. Configure collections manually through admin UI
4. Run `node setup_teams.js` to populate Premier League teams
5. Get your PocketBase URL

**Frontend Setup (Vercel)**  
1. Fork this repository on GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Set root directory to `frontend` in Vercel dashboard
4. Add environment variable: `VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=your-pockethost-url`
5. Deploy automatically from GitHub

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd last-man-standing

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env  # Add your admin credentials

# Backend (local testing)
cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve  # http://localhost:8090

# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173

# Run tests
npm test  # 16 unit tests for game logic
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Game Flow
1. **Auto-Assignment**: When each week starts, all users automatically get their first available alphabetical team
2. **Pick Changes**: Users can change their auto-assigned pick before the deadline (6 hours before first match)
3. **Match Day**: Premier League games are played  
4. **Winner Marking**: Admin marks winning teams (manual + API auto-fill)
5. **Elimination**: System automatically eliminates users whose teams lost
6. **Next Week**: Cycle repeats with new auto-assignments

### Key Game Logic
- **Week 1**: Everyone gets Aston Villa (first alphabetically)
- **Later Weeks**: Users get first available team they haven't used yet  
- **Elimination**: Only triggered for weeks with declared winners
- **Skipped Weeks**: Weeks with no winners are completely ignored (handles season gaps)

## 🔧 Admin Guide

### Setting Up a Season
1. **User Creation**: Add all players through Admin → Manage Users
2. **Current Week**: System auto-detects from deadlines table
3. **Auto-Assignment**: Happens immediately when users load the pick page
4. **Deadline Management**: Automatic (6 hours before first match)

### Weekly Management  
1. **Monitor Picks**: Use "All Players Picks History" to see current participation
2. **Mark Winners**: Admin → Mark Winners (auto-fills from API when available)
3. **Check Eliminations**: System handles automatically based on winners
4. **Next Week**: Auto-assignments happen when users visit pick page

### Admin Privileges
- See all current picks before deadline in "All Players Picks History"
- Mark winners for any week with manual selection or API auto-fill
- Reset entire game to start from any week (though manual DB work may be needed)
- Create and manage user accounts
